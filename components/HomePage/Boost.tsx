        <h2>1-year warranty boost</h2>
        <p>
          ZEN cards have a very neat feature that will help you whenever your
          electronic devices start failing after the standard warranty ends,
          which is pretty common.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you buy any electronics with your ZEN shopping MastercardÂ®, their
          warranty gets extended by one year. How does it work? It simply does.
          Automatically.
